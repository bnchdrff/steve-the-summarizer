# 
# A URL is blacklisted if: 
# 
# 1. Url is an exact match against a member of the urls array
# 2. The host of a URL is a *partial match* of *any part* of the url.
# 
# For example, adding "example.org" to the domains would block *ALL* of the 
# following URLs:
# 
# a) http://foo.com/search?q=example.org
# b) http://example.org.foo.com/anything
# 
:domains:
- example.com
- example.org
:urls:
- http://example.org/index.html
- http://example.com/index.html
